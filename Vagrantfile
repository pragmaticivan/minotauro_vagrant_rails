  # Provider-specific configuration so you can fine-tune various
  # backing providers for Vagrant. These expose provider-specific options.
  # Example for VirtualBox:
  #
  config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |v|
    # Don't boot with headless mode
    v.gui = false
  
    # Use VBoxManage to customize the VM. For example to change memory:
    v.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--memory", "1024"]
    v.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--cpuexecutioncap", "95"]
    v.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--natdnshostresolver1", "on"]
    v.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--natdnsproxy1", "on"]
  end
  #
  # View the documentation for the provider you're using for more
  # information on available options.
